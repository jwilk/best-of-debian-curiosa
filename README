Subject: *Re: Bug#646804: ITP: cheermeup -- Send affirmative messages to the user via the notification library*

         \* Package name    : cheermeup

         [â€¦]

         Send an an affirmative message to the currently logged in users via the notification library. The
         affirmative messages are intended to boost the user's self-esteem by telling the user he or she
         is a great person, that someone loves him or her, etc.

      Seriously?

   Steve, you are an intelligent man and much praise-worthy.

      Okay, I've just signed up for [debian-project].  I'm in a bit of a
      rush at the moment, but will respond tomorrow.

   I'll send another email later, when I have more time, to explain how
   I feel about email pre-notifications for other emails.  The short
   version: everyone should do those, it's quite helpful to get some
   advance notice when someone is planning to post an email with content.
   Then we can be on the lookout for it.

      We are a community, not a company. We are immune to acquisitions.

   NOBODY expects the Debian acquisition!
